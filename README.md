Federated Learning with Differential Privacy + MLflow &amp; Optuna


CNN Framework with extensive hyperparamter optimization using optuna and model tracking with mlflow. Best performing model is use as baseline for Federated Learning and Federated Learning with Differential Privacy. This is an experimentation project developed to test the efficiency of Federated Learning and Differential Privacy by using a exhaustively tuned CNN model as baseline.
